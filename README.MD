# FRONTEND TEST

## Overview
- A brief solution to interact with the api provided using ReactJS
- The app created is able to show a list of users, parcs and bookings with the funcionality to delete an entry.
- Given the time constraints I did not add the ability to create, search, or filter entries, which I otherwise would have done.

### General technical approach
- There's an express server to serve the files to the user
- Webpack / babel is used to compile to JS and CSS
- React is used as the frontend framework
- Everything should be typed using TypeScript
- There is some basic styling with SCSS
- Jest is used for a testing framework, with a few tests added.
